# Bokeh_test_site
Test website to play with the different configurations of Bokeh, data collection and embedding it into a webpage.

This simple app was made in order to showcase and test the use of Bokeh library in Python.
It gets financial info about HPQ (Hewlett Packard Inc) from Yahoo finance webpage, and plots a graph with Bokeh. It uses
pandas to store the information inside a dataframe and also flask for the website itself.
This was made with the help of a Python refresh course on Udemy.
